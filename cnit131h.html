          <h3>noodle soup</h3>
          <p>
            Noodle soups commonly originate from Asia, and there are variations
            across East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.
            <br />
            In China, there are disparities between noodle soups in Chongqing,
            Lanzhou, Hokkien, and Guangzhou. Each city has their own version of
            noodle soup. There are also cart noodles in Hong Kong, whcih consist
            of tea eggs or fish balls. These are usually made by sellers who
            make noodles out of street carts. North and South Korea and Japan
            also have buckwheat noodles and ramen noodles, respectively. Ramen
            is a staple, as Japan introduced ramen to South Korea.

            In Southeast Asia, Cambodia has similar noodles to those of China
            because of Chinese influence. There is also num banchok, which is a
            breakfast soup. Laotian laksa is a vermicelli soup, but many Laotian
            noodle dishes consist of white noodles. However, Indonesian noodles
            are usually yellow and have chicken broth or beef broth in them.

          <h3>restorative soup</h3>
          <p>
            Restorative soups are based on yin and yang in Chinese culture.
            <br>
            If you eat a medicinal and restorative soup, it is oftentimes meant
            for you to balance your body. There may be too much yin or yang
            which would throw somebody off balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some common soup ingredients include chicken and chyrsanthemum.
            There are also fruit soups, such as making soup out of apples and
            papaya to restore health. Ginger and red ginseng are also common
            herbal ingredients. These help with digestion and blood circulation.
